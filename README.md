# WMHamburgerButton
A hamburger button with nice animation.
Inspired by ![Popping](https://github.com/schneiderandre/popping).
Thanks for the nice repo!

## Overview
The animation is created through `Core Animation`, so you don't need to rely on `pop`.

## Usage

The `WMHamburgerButton` is extended from `UIControl`, you can use it just like a button.
Constrain it's `frame` either by `frame property` or `autoLayout`!

## AND THAT'S IT, ENJOY!
